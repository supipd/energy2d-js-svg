Energy2D-JS is a JavaScript port of the excelent Java application: [Energy2D](http://energy.concord.org/energy2d/index.html) originated by:

Charles Xie, [Interactive Heat Transfer Simulations for Everyone](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.3694080), The Physics Teacher, Volume 50, Issue 4, pp. 237-240, 2012.

This repository is successor of [energy2d-js](https://github.com/concord-consortium/energy2d-js) GitHub repository

Aim of this rework is javascript port fully compliant (in term of comparable results) with main Java version.

Testing implementation: [working demo](http://www.sbmintegral.sk/GITHUB/energy2d-js-svg/model2d-demo.html)

# Work in progress

### Warning:

Browser compatibility is NOT aim of this rework ! I'm working on regularly updated Google Chrome, and no problems with another browsers don't interested me.
